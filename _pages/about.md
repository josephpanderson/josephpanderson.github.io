Hi, I'm Joe! I'm currently a second year Ph.D. student in Ocean Sciences at the [University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science](http://rsmas.miami.edu). Prior to coming to RSMAS, I completed my MS in Applied Statistics at the [University of Texas at San Antonio](http://utsa.edu) in 2016, and my BS in Mathematics at [Texas A&M University](http://tamu.edu) in 2013. I also worked as a Decision Science Analyst at [USAA](http://usaa.com), and as a Processing Geophysicist at Seismic Exchange (now called [SEIMAX Technologies](http://seimaxtech.com)).

My research interests are in the application of machine learning to radar remote sensing data, particularly synthetic aperture radar (SAR). I'm currently using machine learning and computer vision to automatically segment sea ice and determine the floe size distribution in images from SAR satellites. My programming language of choice is Python, but I occasionaly use MATLAB and IDL. My research is primarily conducted behind a computer, although working with marine radar has given me the opportunity to assist in the operation of a ship mounted radar (and hopefully many more opportunities to follow).
