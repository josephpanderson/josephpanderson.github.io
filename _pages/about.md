About Me
======
Hi, I'm Joe!I'm currently a second year Ph.D. student in Ocean Sciences at the [University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science](rsmas.miami.edu). Prior to coming to RSMAS, I completed my MS in Applied Statistics at the [University of Texas at San Antonio](utsa.edu) in 2016, and my BS in Mathematics at [Texas A&M University](tamu.edu) in 2013. I also worked as a Decision Science Analyst at [USAA](usaa.com), and as a Processing Geophysicist at Seismic Exchange (now called [SEIMAX Technologies](http://seimaxtech.com)).

My research interests are in the application of machine learning to radar remote sensing data, particularly X-band marine and satellite radar. Machine learning and computer vision techniques can be used to detect and track objects, estimate current velocities and internal wave statistics, and predict sea ice trajectories (among other things). My programming language of choice is Python, but I occasionaly use MATLAB and IDL. My research is primarily conducted behind a computer, although working with marine radar has given me the opportunity to assist in the operation of a ship mounted radar (and hopefully many more opportunities to follow).
